## FE Blog Test

``Basic Skills Assessment``

## The Great Blog Test ====
You're tasked with creating a modern blog layout for a fictitious **Client**. The layout, hierarchy, and user experience of this blog landing page are entirely up to you. So are visuals and functionality, which can be as minimal or fully fleshed out as you see fit, as long as everything meets the content requirements listed in the section below.
If you feel they might assist you in this project, the following are fair game, but not required:
- Dummy content or image generators - CSS frameworks and preprocessors - JavaScript frameworks and plugins
**Please deliver your assessment before your in-person interview.** If this can't be done, contact us to let us know. You can deliver your assessment as a `.zip` file or host it on your own website, as long as we can look at the source code.
Good luck, The Client is counting on you!

## Content Requirements ====

## Global Header ----
``The page's header should contain The Client's logo, a "main navigation" of about five (dummy) links, and a secondary "eyebrow navigation" of two or three links.``

## Articles ----
``The main content of this blog landing page is a listing of at least five article summaries. Each article needs:``
- A title
- Date it was published
- A short summary of the story

- A link to the full story
- A preview image for the story`

## Archive ----
``The archive is a blog-style list of links to view past articles by year.``

## Popular Content ----
``There are three types of popular content The Client would like to promote, each featuring 10 article links:``
- Most Viewed
- Most Commented - Most Shared
(The Client suggested a tabbed widget for these three lists, but the final solution is up to you.)

## Newsletter ----
``The Client is asking for a simple call to action to sign up for the blog's newsletter. A form that captures the reader's email address should suffice.``

## Global Footer ----
``The page's footer will only contain a copyright statement with the year and The Client's name.``
