          <h2>Welcome to something useless, but hopefully fun</h2>
          <p>Thank you for stopping by this page. This is a quick game for those who want to test their Trump quote knowledge. Below is a quick explanation of how the game works. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Once you click play you will see a quote, and have to click True or False to whether or not this was actually said by Donald Trump.</li>
            <li>If you get it right it will counted in your correct answers near the bottom, and if you get it wrong it will be put as a strike against you.</li>
            <li>Once you get three strikes you will lose the game.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.</p>
